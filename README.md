# Salary Negotiation

This is an application that helps negotiate salary between the prospective employee
and the employer trying to hire that person.

It's been created for the purpose of demonstration of Vue.js capabilities. There are
no other libraries used beyond just Vue.js. This project has been scaffolded using
vue-cli so part of the documentation is obviously automatically generated.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## Closing thoughts
Alternatively after you build the app serve the dist folder using your favorite HTTP server.
I use the 'http-server' node package installed globally but that's just my own preference :).

Cheers!
